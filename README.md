# Hi,
### This is ReelX, an open-source project by me. Welcome To ReelX, just watch your favorite movies at relax.

**Here is the source code:** [ReelX](https://github.com/learner-of-string/reelx-sources/)
**Here is the optimized version:** [ReelX](https://learner-of-string.github.io/reelx/)

### What is ReelX?

- `ReelX` is an open source personal movie listing tool. With ReelX, you can take a list all of your favorite movies and watch then at any time.

- You have to fill an extra input field besides movie name and ott, where you can take the url where you will watch that particular movie.

- When you will start typing to add a new movie, it will automatically show if that movie already added or not. I mean you can search your movies too.
